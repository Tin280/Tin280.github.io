    <h1>Hello, I'm Tin 👋</h1>

    <p>I'm a passionate and enthusiastic developer with experience in JavaScript, React, and testing using Mocha, Chai,
        and Supertest. Here's a bit about me:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>🌱 I'm currently learning and exploring various programming languages and technologies.</li>
        <li>💼 As a fresher, I've gained valuable experience in JavaScript, React, and testing, specifically using
            Mocha, Chai, and Supertest.</li>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>

    <h3>Country Explorer 🌍</h3>

    <p>I've recently worked on a project called "Country Explorer." It allows you to search for countries by name and
        provides detailed information, including weather, flags, and languages spoken.</p>

    <h3>Phonebook 📞</h3>

    <p>I've also created a "Phonebook" project, where users can easily add and delete contacts as they wish. It's a
        simple and convenient tool for managing your contacts.</p>
