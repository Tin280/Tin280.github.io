## My Projects

### Country Explorer 🌍

I've recently worked on a project called "Country Explorer." It allows you to search for countries by name and provides detailed information, including weather, flags, and languages spoken.

### Phonebook 📞

I've also created a "Phonebook" project, where users can easily add and delete contacts as they wish. It's a simple and convenient tool for managing your contacts.
